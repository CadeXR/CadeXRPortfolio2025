PROJECT DIVE PAGE CONTENT
================================================================================

HEADER:
- Image: ProjectDive.png
- Title: "Project Dive"
- Subtitle: "Next Generation VR Immersion"

CONTENT SECTIONS:

1. PERSONAL STORY:
   "I am working on the designs that can lead to the first generation of a Nervegear-like device. We prototyped an early version at MIT just this January, and I even gave a talk on the prototype and idea at NYU not a few weeks later. I've had conversations with tons of industry professionals I've worked alongside who are interested in seeing a first generation of the device, as well as several large creators in the XR industry I'm already connected with, who would both love to see that prototype and are interested in the project as a whole."

2. THE CONCEPT:
   "The basic overview is a device that is intended to allow full immersion inside a VR device, 'jacking in' like in The Matrix or Sword Art Online. But instead of waiting 10 years for some sort of outrageously expensive BCI technology or Neuralink chip to somehow be cheap and widespread, the system I am designing uses EKG and EIT kits to detect imperceptible muscle contractions in the legs and arms. These contractions are fed through an algorithm that translates these movements into control inputs that are agnostic with all immersive software (like SteamVR). A lot of the design for this device is based around hardware developed at MIT, found in this research paper: EIT-Kit Research Paper (https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/research/eit-kit/eit-kit.html)."

3. HOW IT WORKS:
   - Bio-Signal Detection: EKG and EIT systems detect micro-movements
   - Signal Processing: Proprietary algorithms analyze bio-signals in real-time

4. HOW IT FEELS:
   "The best way to describe how the device would feel is imagine laying down in your bed, and very lightly moving the muscles you use to walk. Every time you engage each leg you take a step. Now imagine this across the body, barely flexing a muscle in your arm to lift it, or grabbing door handles by very lightly contracting the same muscle you use to grip. Tying this system with a cheap, basic focus BCI device and eye tracking, I think a fully accessible, completely immersive and futuristic control method is possible."

5. INTENTIONAL LOCOMOTION:
   "We originally called this system 'Intentional Locomotion' as it's controlling an XR rig entirely out of intent, instead of clunky un-immersive modern control schemes. And a future with a device like this could vastly increase retention in the XR space, going from Meta's recent 'comfort zone' of 20-40 minutes in VR, to hours of perfectly immersive, comfortable VR."

6. THE FUTURE OF VR:
   "Imagine a world where VR isn't just a gaming platform, but a true extension of human experience. Where you can work, socialize, create, and explore in virtual spaces that feel as natural as the physical world. This technology could revolutionize not just gaming, but remote work, education, therapy, and social interaction."

7. DEVELOPMENT STATUS:
   "After successfully prototyping at MIT in January 2024 and presenting at NYU shortly after, we're currently working on the final design pipeline and sourcing hardware components for the next iteration."

SUPPORT PAGE CONTENT
================================================================================

HEADER:

- Title: "Support My Open Source Work"

CONTENT:
"Hi! If you've reached this page, that's because you were curious about one of my open source apps. I distribute my open source applications for free, allowing other developers like myself to have access to constantly updating tools that can further along their projects in the XR space. I make these as tools for myself internally, and over time build them up into fully-fledged applications that are scalable. These take a lot of time, and I want to keep making these tools. If you feel like supporting me, and allowing me to continue to make tools like these, I would appreciate it if you donated to my Ko-fi! Even the smallest donations help me spend time making these tools! Thank you so much! - CadeXR"

KO-FI LINK:
- URL: https://ko-fi.com/cadexr
- Button text: "â˜• Support on Ko-fi"

OPEN SOURCE PHILOSOPHY:
"I believe in the power of open source software to drive innovation and collaboration in the XR space. By keeping my tools free and accessible, I hope to lower the barrier to entry for developers and creators who want to build amazing experiences in virtual and augmented reality. Every contribution, no matter how small, helps me continue this mission and ensures that these tools remain available to everyone in the community."
